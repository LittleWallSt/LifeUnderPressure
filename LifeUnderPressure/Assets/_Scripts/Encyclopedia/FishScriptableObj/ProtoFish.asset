    fish renowned for its vibrant orange body with distinctive white stripes edged
    in black. The fish are protected by the anemones' stinging tentacles, which deter
    predators, while the clownfish help keep the anemone clean and free of parasites.

    born male but can change to female when needed. Their bright coloration and fascinating
    behavior have made them popular in both aquariums and marine studies."
