  fishSmallDescription: 'Of all the bioluminescent life forms in the deep sea, there
    is one tiny creature who''s light show puts all others to shame. '
  infoWhere: firefly squid could anywhere beware
  fishFullDescription: 'This is the firefly squid, sometimes called the sparkling
    enope squid. Known to science as Watasenia scintillans, it is referred to in
    Japan as "hotaru-ika". It is a member of the cephalopod family and is related
    to many other squid species throughout the world''s oceans. The firefly squid
    gets its name from the flashing lights that resemble those of a firefly. This
    squid is famous for the incredible light show that occurs each year off the coast
    of Japan as millions of these tiny animals gather to spawn.



    The squid
    is equipped with special light-producing organs called photophores. These photophores
    are found on many parts of the squid''s body and emit a deep blue light. Large
    photophores can be found on the tips of the tentacles as well as around the eyes.
    Thousands of tiny photophores can be found throughout the squid''s body, giving
    it the ability to emit light along its entire form. The lights can be flashed
    in unison or alternated in an endless number of animated patterns.'
