  fishSmallDescription: As gigantic as the ocean sunfish can be, it still seems like
    only half a fish.
  fishFullDescription: "Sunfish, or mola, develop their truncated, bullet-like shape
    because the back fin which they are born with simply never grows. Instead, it
    folds into itself as the enormous creature matures, creating a rounded rudder
    called a clavus. Mola in Latin means \"millstone\" and describes the ocean sunfish\u2019s
    somewhat circular shape. They are a silvery color and have a rough skin texture.\r\n\r\nMola
    are found in temperate and tropical oceans around the world. They are frequently
    seen basking in the sun near the surface and are often mistaken for sharks when
    their huge dorsal fins emerge above the water. Their teeth are fused into a beak-like
    structure, and they are unable to fully close their relatively small mouths."
