  fishFullDescription: "Ooo the Green Sea Turtle. Nice one! \r\n\r\nThese guys may
    dive deeper to escape predators or search for food, but they usually prefer shallower
    waters.\n\nThe green sea turtles are primarily herbivorous, feeding on seagrasses
    and algae, and are often found in shallow coastal waters, making them a vital
    part of marine ecosystems.\r\n\r\nAlso, they are able to hold their breath for
    up to five hours, the longest a human has been able to do is less than 25 minutes.\r"
