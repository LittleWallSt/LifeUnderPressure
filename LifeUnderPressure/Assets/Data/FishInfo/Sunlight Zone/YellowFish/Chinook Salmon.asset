  fishFullDescription: "So you found the interesting Chinook Salmon. These guys live
    in both Rivers and the ocean during their life cycle. They start in rivers, where
    they are bred in freshwater rivers and streams. This is usually for the first
    few months to a year. After this time, they start migrating into the ocean. They
    spend several years feeding and growing. They can be found in the North Pacific
    Ocean, from California to Alaska and across to Japan. \r\n\r\nFreshwater (Rivers/Streams):
    Chinook salmon are born in freshwater rivers and streams. They spend the first
    part of their lives (usually a few months to a year) in freshwater before migrating
    to the ocean. When they reach maturity, they return to the same freshwater river
    where they were born to spawn, traveling long distances upstream.\r\n\r\n\r\nA
    female lays 3,000 to 14,000 eggs at once.\r"
