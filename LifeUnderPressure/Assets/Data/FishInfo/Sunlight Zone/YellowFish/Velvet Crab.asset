  fishSmallDescription: "Velvet Crab, also known as (Necora puber) is a tiny crab
    that is described as a \u201Cdevil\u201D due to its reddish eyes."
  infoWhere: These devil-looking crabs live between the depths of 0 to 80 m. They
    live inshore and rockpool crevices amongst weeds and rocks.
  fishFullDescription: "Uh.. the Velvet Crab i suppose this is an ok scan \r\n\r\nThese
    tiny crabs (Shell width up to 10cm) are not the friendliest. If you disturb these
    guys, they will want to get you with their claws. Some scuba-diving websites
    have described their behaviour as \u201Cunlikely to do harm, but will have a
    go nonetheless\u201D. Most crabs can be controlled by handling a side of the
    carapace, which ensures the crab can't reach you with its claws. But the velvet
    crab is able to contort itself and deliver an eyewatering pinch.\r\n"
