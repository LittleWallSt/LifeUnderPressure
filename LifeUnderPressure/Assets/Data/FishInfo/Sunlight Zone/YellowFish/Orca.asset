  fishFullDescription: "You found the famous Killer Whale, not a bad scan..\r\n\r\nThe
    Killer Whale, an Apex predator at the top of the food chain. It has a diverse
    diet, feasting on fish, penguins, and marine mammals such as seals, sea lions,
    and whales. They also eat fish, squid, and seabirds. \r\n\r\nWhen they hunt,
    they are known to play with their food, throwing it into the air. This might
    be a playful manner or a strategic hunting tactic.\r\n\r\nOrcas' life spans are
    quite similar to human ones, with females averaging 80 years and males averaging
    70 years. \r\nThey also stay pregnant for around 17 months. Females usually give
    birth around every 3-5 years, but at times it can take a decade to have a successful
    birth. \r\n"
