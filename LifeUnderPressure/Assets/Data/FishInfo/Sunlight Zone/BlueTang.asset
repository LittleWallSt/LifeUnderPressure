    Blue
    Tangs are not commercially fished due to their small size and limited value.
    However, they are highly sought after for home and public aquariums due to their
    beautiful coloration and active swimming behavior.

    

    Despite their
    beauty, eating Blue Tangs is not recommended. They can sometimes carry ciguatera
    toxin, a harmful substance produced by certain marine algae, which can cause
    ciguatera poisoning when consumed. This toxin is often present in tropical reef
    fish and can lead to serious health issues.
