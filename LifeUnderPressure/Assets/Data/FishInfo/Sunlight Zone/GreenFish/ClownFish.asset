  fishSmallDescription: 'The Clownfish (Amphiprioninae) is a striking orange-and-white
    fish known for its vibrant colouration and unique patterns. And is also the fish
    that Nemo was based on.

'
  infoWhere: Clownfish are usually found in shallow coastal seaward reefs at depths
    of 1 to 12m. They prefer warm waters and are often seen living among the tentacles
    of sea anemones, which provide them with protection and a unique habitat.
  fishFullDescription: "Great! The Clown Fish is scanned. \n\nThe clown fish also
    called Amphiprioninae loves finding shelter among the anemone\u2019s stinging
    tentacles, gaining protection from predators while providing nutrients to the
    anemone. \n\nClownfish are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning that they all
    mature as males but can change their sex to female. Should something happen to
    the female, the male of the breeding pair changes to a female, rapidly increasing
    in size. The next largest male usually becomes the breeding male.\n\nThere is
    also a rare black variation that can be found around Darwin, Australia."
