  fishName: Giant Pacific Octopus
  fishSmallDescription: 'Giant Pacific Octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) is quite big
    and old. They live for about four years. '
  infoWhere: This smart one usually lives between 0 and 200m but has been spotted
    as far down as 400m. It likes to stay in crevices and caves, where it can hide
    from predators and ambush prey.
  fishFullDescription: 'Interesting catch, I had no idea caves were so dangerous
    underwater. Well worth the risk, though. Great scan!

    

    The Giant Pacific
    Octopus has an interesting feature: its skin has special pigment cells. These
    cells allow the octopus to change colors and textures, which is great because
    it can blend in with even the most intricately patterned corals, plants, and
    rocks.

    

    Hunting is something they do at night, surviving mainly on
    shrimps, clams, lobsters and fish. They have been known to attack and eat sharks
    aswell.

    

    They are highly intelligent creatures. They have learned
    to open jars, mimic other octopuses and solve mazes in lab tests. Their population
    numbers arent known and they do not currently appear on any lists of endangered
    or vulnerable animals.'
