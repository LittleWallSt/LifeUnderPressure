  fishSmallDescription: 'The incredible Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is one
    of the world''s greatest animals. This incredible animal is the largest animal
    that we know to have ever existed, bigger than all of the dinosaurs. '
  infoWhere: Blue whales typically stay near the surface of the ocean, around 100m,
    but they are capable of diving further down. The furthest down a Blue Whale has
    been spotted is 500 m.
  fishFullDescription: 'You got the incredible Blue Whale scanned, and I''m jealous.

    

    Blue
    Whales eat almost exclusively krill. They feed by swimming through krill swarms
    with their mouths open, taking in water and food. Inside their mouths are baleen
    plates, which act like filters. The whale pushes the water out, trapping the
    krill inside, and then swallows them. This method allows blue whales to eat thousands
    of tiny krill in a single gulp, sometimes up to 6 tons of krill in one gulp.

    

    Blue
    Whales do have to breathe. Exhaling 90% of their lung capacity, the Blue Whale
    will usually surface to breathe every 15-20 minutes. They can stay longer but
    usually do not. One has been recorded to hold its breath for 36 minutes.

    

    During
    their summer feeding grounds, blue whales are commonly found in colder waters,
    such as those near the polar regions. There, they can find a lot of krill, which
    is their primary food source. Even though they do go colder, they have been spotted
    in all oceans except the Arctic Ocean.

    

    Then, during their Breeding
    grounds, winter time, the blue whales migrate to warmer tropical and subtropical
    waters to breed and give birth. These places are usually near the coastal of
    Central America, the Indian ocean and areas around the equator.


    Blue whales
    occasionally swimes in small groups but usually alone or in pairs.'
