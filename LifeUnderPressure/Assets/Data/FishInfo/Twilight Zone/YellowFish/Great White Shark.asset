  fishName: Great White Shark
  fishSmallDescription: Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) I'm sure you know
    how they look. And as scary as they might look, they won't be a problem for the
    submarine. They are curious, though, and might try to take a look at you.
  infoWhere: 'Great whites are commonly found at depths between 0 to 200m. This is
    because they hunt for food here, like seals. But they are capable of diving much
    deeper. Some have been recorded diving as deep as 1200 meters.

'
  fishFullDescription: "Ah, so you scanned the Great White. Im guessing it was kinda
    scary.\r\n\r\nThe Great White is one heavy guy, averaging 2000 kg. These guys
    are a special sort of cold-blooded. They can keep parts of their bodies warmer
    than the water around them, which helps them swim faster, hunt better, and stay
    active in colder waters where most other fish would slow down. This is done with
    a unique system in their bodies that keeps their muscles, eyes, and brain warmer.
    It's like having built-in \u201Cheaters\u201D that help them move quickly and
    stay sharp.\r\n\r\nIn the wild, their life span is usually about 30 to 70 years,
    with some estimates suggesting they reach up to 70 years. Males reach maturity
    around 26 years, while females take a bit longer at around 33 years.\r\n\r\nGreat
    white sharks have a long gestation period (about 11 months) and typically give
    birth to only a small number of pups (about 2 to 14). This slow reproductive
    rate makes it difficult for their populations to recover quickly.\r\n\r\nSo,
    an important thing about Great Whites even that they are apex predators and dont
    face a lot of threats from other fish. They need our help. Currently, their population
    is decreasing faster than it is being produced. This is because of overfishing
    where they are caught for their fins, meat and teeth. There are hunters that
    simply catch them to have some sort of \u201Cfishing trophy\u201D.\r\nPollution
    is also ruining the habitat where sharks tend to reproduce."
