  fishName: Japanese Spider Crab
  fishSmallDescription: One of the largest crabs in the world, with a leg span that
    can reach up to 4m and a weight of over 40 kg
  infoWhere: Spider crabs are found around sandy and rocky continental shelf and
    slopes. On the sea floor. Around 200m - 550m down.
  fishFullDescription: "The Spider Crab (Macrocheira kaempferi), these crabs are
    amazing. Their long, spindly legs and hard shell make them easily recognizable.
    \r\n\r\nThey prefer to stay hidden among rocks and other structures, where they
    can easily find food.\r\nJapanese spider crabs are scavengers and have a varied
    diet that mainly consists of crabs, shrimps, lobsters, and other decapods. They
    play an important role in their ecosystem by helping to keep the ocean floor
    clean.\r\n\r\nDespite their large size, these crabs are known to be gentle and
    are not a threat to humans. They are often seen in Japanese cuisine, although
    their size and unique appearance have also made them popular in aquariums, where
    they attract visitors with their fascinating looks.\r"
