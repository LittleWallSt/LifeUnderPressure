    Firefly
    Squid are mostly found in the deep waters of the western Pacific Ocean, especially
    near Japan. They usually live at depths between 100 and 300 meters but come closer
    to the surface at night to hunt and show off their glowing lights. They also
    communicate with one another and attract prey with their light.


    The diet
    of a firefly squid changes throughout its life stages. During its paralarval
    stage, its diet is primarily composed of calanoid copepods (zooplankton). Subadult
    and adult stages see an increase in dietary diversity to include planktonic crustaceans,
    fishes, and squid.'
