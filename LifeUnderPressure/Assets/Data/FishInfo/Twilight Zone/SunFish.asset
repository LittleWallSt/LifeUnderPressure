  fishSmallDescription: One of the Largest bony fish in the world, the Sun Fish.
    Adults typically weigh between 247 and 1,000 kg.
  infoWhere: Sunfish are typically associated with oceanic waters rather than coastal
    areas. They often inhabit regions where jellyfish are plentiful, as this is their
    primary food source. Usually stay at depths around 0-200m but stay at the top
    most of the time. However can be found as deep down as 600m.
  fishFullDescription: "Congratulations! You\u2019ve scanned the incredible Sunfish!\n\r\nThe
    Sunfish (Mola mola) is known for its unique shape and size. Adults can weigh
    between 247 and 1,000 kg and can grow over 3 meters long. Their flat, disc-like
    body makes them easily recognizable, and they have a large dorsal fin that can
    be seen poking out of the water when they lie very close to the surface for sun.
    Which at times has confused people to think its a shark.\n\r\nSunfish are primarily
    found in warm, open ocean waters. They enjoy sunny spots and are often spotted
    drifting or swimming slowly. These fascinating fish are known for their diet
    of jellyfish, but they also eat other soft-bodied marine animals, like salps
    and squid.\n\r\nOne interesting fact about Sunfish is their unique method of
    feeding. They can often be seen coming to the surface and gulping down their
    food. Despite their size, they are gentle giants and pose no threat to humans.\r\nSunfish
    play an important role in marine ecosystems by helping control jellyfish populations.
    Their presence also indicates healthy ocean habitats, making them an essential
    part of ocean health.\n\nAlso when giving birth they release 300 million eggs
    at a time.\r"
