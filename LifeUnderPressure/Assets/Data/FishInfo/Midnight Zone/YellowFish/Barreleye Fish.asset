  fishSmallDescription: Barreleye (Macropinna microstoma) is a deep-sea fish known
    for its transparent head and weird eyes. These guys having only reached a maximum
    size of 15 cm.
  infoWhere: They live between 600-800m deep, in the twilight zone. They are usually
    found alone, swimming slowly around in dark waters.
  fishFullDescription: 'Now this is an interesting looking fella. Cool scan

    

    This
    weird looking fish has big fins that let them stay almost perfectly still in
    the water or move with great precision. One of their cool features is that their
    tubular eyes which are inside of their heads (which is transparent) This allows
    them to see both above and in front of them as they search for food. Like zooplankton,
    crustaceans, and siphonophores.

    

    This little one has only been spotted
    a few times ever. This makes it so little is known about their reproduction,
    but scientists do believe they are pelagic spawners, meaning that they release
    their eggs and sperm directly into the water.'
