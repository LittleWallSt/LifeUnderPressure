  fishSmallDescription: Colossal Squid (Mesonychoteuthis dosseni) is one of the largest
    squids known, reaching lengths of up to 14 meters or more
  infoWhere: This massive squid usually resides at depths between 300-1000m, primarily
    in the open waters of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. It prefers deep,
    dark waters where it can hunt for its prey.
  fishFullDescription: "Wow, you scanned a Colossal Squid! Now, that's a pretty crazy
    scan.\r\n\r\nThe Colossal Squid is a giant in the ocean, known for its size and
    scariness. It has long muscular arms with sharp suckers and a beak-like mouth.
    It hunts prey, mainly fish and other squid.\r\n\r\nEven though it is enormous,
    this squid is rarely seen by humans. It has particular adaptations for life in
    the deep sea, such as large eyes that help it see in the dark. These eyes can
    be as big as a soccer ball.\r\n\r\nNot much is known about their life span, and
    scientists believe they live for several years, similar to other large squid
    species. They face threats from deep-sea fishing and predators like sperm whales,
    which actively hunt them.\r\n\r\nProtecting their habitat is essential, as human
    activities like pollution often impact the deep sea, which can affect their populations.\r\n\r"
