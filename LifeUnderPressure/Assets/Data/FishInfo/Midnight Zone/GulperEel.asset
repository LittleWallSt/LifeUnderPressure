  fishName: Gulper Eel
  fishSmallDescription: The Gulper Eel is a deep-sea predator known for its enormous,
    pouch-like mouth and snake-like body. Reaching up to 1 meter in length, only
    been spotted 7 times in the last 30 years. Good luck finding it
  infoWhere: Stay between 300-2000 Meters as they swim around and hunt in the open.
  fishFullDescription: "WOW, 8th time in 30 years this eel has been spotted and you
    did it. Good job!\n\nWhiptail Gulper Eel (Saccopharynx lavenbergi) does not have
    too much information out there about it due to how rare it is to spot however
    what we do know is that. It likes to stay at the deep since its source of food
    is there, which consists of small fishes.\r\n\r\nThey have an organ at the end
    of the very long tail, which may be used to attract prey or to attract mates
    but this is simply speculation. \r\n"
