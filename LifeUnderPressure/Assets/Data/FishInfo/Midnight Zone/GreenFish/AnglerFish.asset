  fishFullDescription: "The freaky-looking Humpback angler fish scanned!\r\n\r\nThis
    tiny scary fish is only 2.9cm long for males and 18cm for females. The male has
    the quality of attaching itself to the female and never detaching from her. It
    will fuse with the female and after a whale becomes a part of her.\r\n\r\nThe
    male and female have very different life cycles. The females have large mouths
    filled with sharp teeth and huge stomachs. This makes them able to eat nearly
    everything they encounter. The males are tiny and lack these predatory adaptations.
    The primary role of the male is to find a female and attach to her for reproduction.\r\n\r\nThey
    are an ambush predator which stay in one position waiting for tiny fish to come
    close due to the bioluminescence that lures the fish close. \r"
