  fishSmallDescription: Dumbo Octopus (Grimpoteuthis) is a tiny octopus that has
    big ears and moves around using one of them.
  infoWhere: Usually moves around the bottom of the sea at around 4000m. They will
    at times hide inside their tentacles.
  fishFullDescription: "Nicely done. The Dumbo octopus has been scanned.\n\nKnown
    for their big ears as they were named after Disney\u2019s Dumbo the elephant
    character. These little squids pounce on prey and eat it whole. Their diet includes
    copepods, isopods, bristle worms and amphipods.\n\nThey can survive the intense
    pressure and cold temperatures of the deep ocean by having adapted. The females
    apparently always carry eggs in different stages of development, they are able
    to store sperm for long periods of time after mating with a male. Using these
    advantages female dumbo octopuses can transfer sperm to their most developed
    eggs at any time the environmental conditions are right. They can lay up to 200
    thousand eggs at a time.\n\nThey are also the deepest known genus of all ocopuses."
